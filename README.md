## Timeline Builder

Use Timeline.js to build a timeline! With thanks to the Knight Lab at [NorthWestern University](https://timeline.knightlab.com/).

While you can use a spreadsheet to build your timeline as per the docs, here's a sample of how to build your timeline using JSON.

Run this website locally:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed.
2. Fork this repo and place it on your local machine in a folder.
3. Using the command line, CD (change directory) to the folder: `cd myTimeline`. (or as the case maybe be with what you named your folder)
4. Use `http-server` to quickly start up a local server; from your code's folder run `npx http-server`. You should see a timeline of Whitney Houston's amazing and tragic life.

Build your own JSON structures for a new timeline, [following the docs](https://timeline.knightlab.com/docs/json-format.html).

Evolution of algorithms from ancient to modern AI, showing a timeline from ancient mechanical computers and Euclids algorithm, through Turing's 1936 Computable Numbers paper, early computing theory, the 1958 Perceptron, decision trees, the 1980s-1990s machine learning revival, to 2006 deep learning breakthroughs and 2020s transformers and large language models. Includes key contributors like Al-Khwarizmi and Ada Lovelace. The background features a digital, futuristic environment with glowing network connections, conveying rapid technological progress and innovation.

The tone is inspiring and forward-looking.evolution of AI
